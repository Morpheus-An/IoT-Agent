ANALYSIS:
Based on the given data:
- The mean value of CSI (0.2916398439341546) is close to the mean values in both the examples (0.29464217312574953 and 0.26454713999452073). This indicates a relatively similar level of signal amplitude on average.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time (0.015538880742408896) is slightly lower than the values in the previous examples (0.013818446470635239 and 0.03694852181027022). This suggests less variability in the mean CSI amplitude across different subcarriers over time.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point (0.03386956016458916) is comparable to the values in the previous examples (0.03324765125117169 and 0.08912010674037109).

Based on the analysis, the data shows consistent mean CSI values with lower variability across subcarriers over time. The standard deviation values are also relatively stable. Therefore, the data suggests that there is likely no person present.

- The mean value of CSI in the given data (0.2952765935560094) is slightly higher than the mean value in the "no_person" example (0.29464217312574953) but lower than the mean value in the "have_person" example (0.26454713999452073).
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time in the given data (0.021825610305110266) is higher than the "no_person" example (0.013818446470635239) but lower than the "have_person" example (0.03694852181027022).
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point in the given data (0.0391422294371952) is higher than the "no_person" example (0.03324765125117169) and lower than the "have_person" example (0.08912010674037109).

Based on the analysis:
- The mean value of CSI is slightly higher than the "no_person" example but lower than the "have_person" example.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is higher than the "no_person" example but lower than the "have_person" example.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is higher than the "no_person" example and lower than the "have_person" example.

Therefore, considering the higher mean value of CSI and standard deviation across subcarriers, but lower mean standard deviation compared to the "have_person" example, the analysis suggests that there is potentially a person present.

ANALYSIS:
1. The mean value of CSI: 0.29278478537735514 - This represents the average amplitude of the CSI data.
2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.01647351195143502 - This measures the variability of the mean CSI amplitude across different subcarriers over time.
3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.033544148492334905 - This describes the average standard deviation of CSI signals for each subcarrier over time, reflecting the overall degree of signal oscillation.

Comparing the given data with the examples:

Based on the given data and comparing it to the examples provided:

1. The mean value of CSI in the given data (0.290) is close to the mean values in the examples (0.294 and 0.264), indicating a similar level of signal amplitude in the CSI data.
2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time in the given data (0.017) is lower than in the examples (0.013 and 0.036), suggesting less variability in the mean CSI amplitude across different subcarriers over time.
3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point in the given data (0.035) falls within the range of the examples (0.033 and 0.089), showing a moderate level of signal oscillation over time.

Based on this analysis, considering the similarities in mean value and standard deviations, it is likely that there is **no_person** present in the indoor space at the time of data collection. The relatively stable mean values and lower standard deviations indicate a consistent and less variable CSI data, which typically aligns with an empty or unoccupied space.

ANALYSIS:
- The mean value of CSI: 0.288826078016865
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.01938752633787508
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.03489634791039612

In comparison to the examples provided:
- The mean value of CSI in the given data (0.288826078016865) falls within the range of values from the examples (0.26454713999452073 to 0.29464217312574953), indicating a moderate signal amplitude.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time (0.01938752633787508) is also within a similar range to the examples (0.013818446470635239 to 0.03694852181027022), suggesting some variability in the mean CSI amplitude over time.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point (0.03489634791039612) falls in line with the examples (0.03324765125117169 to 0.08912010674037109), reflecting a moderate degree of signal oscillation in time.

Based on the analysis, the data does not deviate significantly from the examples, and the values align with both no_person and have_person scenarios. However, considering the overall patterns and given the moderate signal characteristics, the final answer to the question "Is there a person or not?" would lean towards **no_person** due to the lack of distinct indicators suggesting human occupancy.

ANALYSIS:
- The mean value of CSI in the given data is 0.2878799133079328, which is closer to the mean value in the example of "no_person" (0.29073189749148304) than the example of "have_person" (0.26454713999452073). This suggests a lower average signal amplitude, indicating a potentially lower chance of human presence.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.0178878902438054, which is similar to the example of "no_person" (0.01783772451994059). This means that the variation in signal amplitude across different subcarriers is comparable to the scenario without a person.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.035391471823714014, which is higher than the example of "no_person" (0.029130544771879586). This implies a higher degree of signal oscillation over time, which can be indicative of human presence causing fluctuations in the CSI data.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the given data, considering the lower mean value of CSI, similar standard deviation across subcarriers, and higher mean standard deviation across time points, it is likely that there is no person present in the indoor space. Therefore, the conclusion is:

From the given data:
- The mean value of CSI: 0.2984524848391271
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.01748282327033112
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.03140128361057392

Comparing these values to the examples provided:
- Example 1 had a mean CSI value of 0.29464217312574953, slightly lower than the given data.
- Example 1 had a standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time of 0.013818446470635239, smaller than the given data.
- Example 1 had a mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point of 0.03324765125117169, larger than the given data.
- Example 2 had a mean CSI value of 0.26454713999452073, lower than the given data.
- Example 2 had a standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time of 0.03694852181027022, slightly larger than the given data.
- Example 2 had a mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point of 0.08912010674037109, much larger than the given data.

The slight increase in the mean CSI value and the decrease in standard deviation across subcarriers over time compared to Example 1, along with a smaller mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point indicate less variability in the data. However, these values are still closer to Example 1 than Example 2. 

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis, the given data reflects a pattern more similar to Example 1, where no person was detected. Therefore, the final answer is: no_person.

ANALYSIS:
Based on the previous examples, we can see that when there is a person present, the mean value of CSI tends to be lower and the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is higher compared to when there is no person present. Additionally, the mean std of CSI across the time axis is also higher when a person is detected.

In the given data:
- The mean value of CSI: 0.2957043977376041 (slightly higher than the previous examples)
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.013699233068888282 (similar to the previous examples)
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.032971980372683125 (slightly lower than the previous examples)

Based on the analysis, it seems that the data aligns more with the characteristics of "no_person" as the mean CSI value is slightly higher and the mean std of CSI across the time axis is slightly lower compared to when a person is present.
