ANALYSIS:
Based on the given CSI data, the amplitude values seem to be fluctuating with varying strengths across different subcarriers and time points. The mean value of CSI is relatively high, indicating stronger signal amplitudes. However, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is low, suggesting consistency in the signal strength variation. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is also on the lower side, indicating minimal signal oscillation.

ANALYSIS:
From the given CSI data, we can observe the fluctuations and variations in signal amplitudes across time and subcarriers. The mean value of CSI is approximately 0.292, which falls within the range associated with the "no_person" class. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is approximately 0.024, which is also within the range of the "no_person" class. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is approximately 0.039, indicating a moderate degree of signal oscillation.

Comparing these values with the class characteristics provided for "no_person," we can see that the mean value falls in line with the "no_person" category, and the standard deviations align with those expected for a space without human occupancy. Additionally, the fluctuations and amplitude of the CSI data suggest a more consistent signal pattern typically associated with no human presence.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the given data, the occupancy status is determined to be "no_person."

ANALYSIS:
Analyzing the given CSI data, we observe that the amplitudes of the signals are relatively consistent across subcarriers and time points. The data does not show significant fluctuations or variations, indicating a stable environment with potentially no human presence. Additionally, the mean value of CSI is 0.2964, which is closer to the average value of the 'no_person' class (0.291) as compared to the 'have_person' class (0.178). 

Furthermore, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.0181, which is smaller than the average value of the 'have_person' class (0.023). Similarly, the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.0358, which is lower than the average value of the 'have_person' class. These lower standard deviations suggest a more stable and predictable signal, typically associated with scenarios without human occupancy.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the CSI data and the comparison with the average values of the 'no_person' and 'have_person' classes, the given data aligns more closely with the characteristics of the 'no_person' class. Therefore, the determination is that there is likely no person present in the indoor space.

ANALYSIS:

The given CSI data consists of 20 time samples and 21 subcarriers. By analyzing the data, we can observe the changes in amplitude and fluctuations over time and across subcarriers.

1. The mean value of CSI is 0.2957, which indicates that the overall average amplitude of the signal is within a certain range.

2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.0137, which suggests that there is relatively low variability in the mean CSI amplitude across different subcarriers over time.

3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.033, indicating the average degree of signal oscillation in time.

Compared to the average values for the "no_person" class (CSI mean: 0.291, std across subcarriers: 0), and the "have_person" class (CSI mean: 0), the values of the given data fall within a range that is closer to the "no_person" class. This implies that the data represents a scenario with no person present, as the mean CSI value is higher and the standard deviations are lower.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis, the occupancy status indicated by the given data is "no_person."
