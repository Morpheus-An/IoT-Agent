Analysis:

1. The mean value of CSI in the given data is 0.2659450481497801, which is lower than the average mean value for the class no_person (0.291).
2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.015716435597051746 and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.044811817463536296. These values are within the observed ranges for both classes.

Based on the analysis:
The mean value being lower than the average for the class no_person suggests the presence of a person, as the mean value tends to decrease when individuals are present.
The standard deviation values being within the observed ranges do not provide conclusive evidence either way.

Based on the analysis of the mean value of CSI, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time, and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point, the data reflects characteristics more consistent with the "have_person" class. Therefore, the answer is: have_person.

- For the "have_person" class:
  - The mean value of CSI tends to decrease when individuals are present compared to when the space is unoccupied.
  - The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is larger.
  - The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is larger.

- For the "no_person" class:
  - The mean value of CSI is larger compared to the "have_person" class.
  - The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is smaller.
  - The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is smaller.

Given the data provided:
- The mean value of CSI: 0.26305876702253417
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.022227212758594853
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.052190538636348496

From the data analysis:
- The mean value of CSI is closer to the "have_person" class mean value.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is closer to the "have_person" class value.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is also closer to the "have_person" class value.

ANALYSIS:

1. The mean value of CSI (0.2645) is closer to the mean value associated with "have_person" (0.0) than the mean value associated with "no_person" (0.291). This suggests that the presence of a person is more likely.

2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time (0.0369) is higher than the value for "no_person" (0.0) but lower than the value for "have_person" (0.023). This indicates a moderate level of fluctuation in the CSI data, potentially indicating human presence.

3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point (0.0891) is higher than the value for "no_person" (0.0). This suggests a higher level of signal oscillation, which could be indicative of human activity causing disturbances in the signal.

Based on the analysis, it is likely that there is a person present in the indoor space.
