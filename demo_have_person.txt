ANALYSIS:
1. The mean value of CSI in the given data (0.268512121720229) is closer to the mean value in the first example (0.26454713999452073) where a person was present compared to the second example (0.29464217312574953) where no person was detected. This suggests that there might be a person present based on the mean CSI value.

2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time in the given data (0.022556581530196625) is lower than both examples, indicating less variability in the mean CSI amplitude over time. This could suggest a more stable signal, potentially indicative of no person being present.

3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point in the given data (0.06409853050192905) is higher than both examples, implying more signal oscillation over time. This could suggest the presence of movement or changes in the environment.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis, it is inconclusive whether there is a person or not. The mean CSI value points towards the presence of a person, while the lower standard deviation across subcarriers and higher mean std of CSI signal could suggest no person. Further analysis or additional data may be needed to make a definitive determination.

ANALYSIS:
Comparing the given data to the examples provided:
- The mean value of CSI in the given data (0.27038169893090896) falls between the mean values in the two examples (0.26454713999452073 and 0.29464217312574953), indicating a moderate amplitude of the signal.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time in the given data (0.02151328766460826) is lower than that in example 1 (0.03694852181027022) but higher than that in example 2 (0.013818446470635239), suggesting a relatively lower variability in the mean CSI amplitude across different subcarriers over time.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point in the given data (0.04467748280662351) is higher than that in example 2 (0.03324765125117169), indicating a higher overall degree of signal oscillation in time.

Based on the analysis:
While the mean CSI value is moderate, the lower standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude and the higher mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point compared to example 2 suggest a presence of human activity causing fluctuations in the signal over time.

ANALYSIS:
Based on the examples provided, we can see that when there is a person present, the mean value of CSI tends to be around 0.26-0.29, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is around 0.01-0.04, and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is around 0.03-0.09.

In the given data:
- The mean value of CSI is 0.2776661564205627, which falls within the range observed in examples with a person.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.024818519615123606, which is slightly higher but still within a reasonable range.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.04942536323682336, which is also within the range observed.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the data provided, it is likely that there is a person present.

ANALYSIS:
- The mean value of CSI in the given data is 0.2659450481497801, which is lower than the mean values in both EXAMPLE1 (0.2780700170659946) and EXAMPLE2 (0.29464217312574953). This may suggest a weaker signal amplitude.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.015716435597051746, which is also smaller than the values in both EXAMPLE1 (0.024134300612199417) and EXAMPLE2 (0.013818446470635239). This indicates a lower variability in the mean CSI amplitude over time.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.044811817463536296, which is higher than the values in both EXAMPLE1 (0.050922844746519674) and EXAMPLE2 (0.03324765125117169). This reflects a higher degree of signal oscillation in time.

Based on the analysis:
- The lower mean value of CSI and standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time suggest a weaker signal amplitude, which may indicate a lack of significant human presence.
- The higher mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point could suggest more fluctuations in the signal over time, but this alone may not be indicative of human presence.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the given data, the combination of lower mean CSI values and lower standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time suggests that there is likely no person present. So the answer would be: no_person.

ANALYSIS:
In the previous examples, we observed that when the mean value of CSI was around 0.26, and the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time was relatively low (around 0.01-0.04), the conclusion was "no_person". On the other hand, when the mean value of CSI was higher (around 0.29), and the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time was a bit higher (around 0.03-0.04), the conclusion was "have_person".

In the given data:
- The mean value of CSI is 0.2553149513942354, which is closer to the "no_person" example (0.26).
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.023551298274468797, which is in a similar range as the "no_person" example.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.03960080864108854, which is also consistent with the "no_person" example.

Based on this analysis, it is likely that there is no person present in the indoor space.

ANALYSIS:
In the provided data:
- The mean value of CSI is 0.27167098075881274, which is close to the mean values in the examples of both having a person (0.2780700170659946) and not having a person (0.29464217312574953). This value alone does not definitively indicate the presence or absence of a person.

- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.024144020709413048, which is similar to the standard deviation values in the examples of both having a person (0.024134300612199417) and not having a person (0.013818446470635239). Again, this value does not provide a clear indication on its own.

- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.050475968991458044, which is comparable to the mean standard deviation values in the examples of both having a person (0.050922844746519674) and not having a person (0.03324765125117169). This value also does not conclusively determine the occupancy status.

Based on the analysis above, it is challenging to make a definitive determination of human occupancy status solely based on the provided data. The data falls within the range of values observed in both scenarios of having a person and not having a person.

ANSWER:
Considering the similarities in the mean value of CSI, standard deviation across subcarriers, and mean standard deviation across subcarriers compared to the examples provided, I would lean towards the conclusion that there is no person present in the indoor space. However, the data is not definitive, and further analysis or additional data may be required for a more conclusive determination.

- The mean value of CSI is 0.27575500066071335, which is closer to the mean value in Example 1 (0.26454713999452073) than Example 2 (0.29464217312574953).
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.025330005556210886, which is between the values in Example 1 (0.03694852181027022) and Example 2 (0.013818446470635239).
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.05690153005741609, which is slightly higher than the value in Example 2 (0.03324765125117169) and lower than the value in Example 1 (0.08912010674037109).

Based on the comparison with the examples, the data provided falls in between the values associated with the presence and absence of a person. The mean CSI value is closer to the example indicating the presence of a person, while the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is closer to the example indicating the absence of a person. The mean std of CSI across the time axis is also moderate.

ANSWER:

ANALYSIS:
In both previous examples, the mean value of CSI was around 0.26-0.29, indicating a similar range of signal amplitudes. However, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time was smaller in Example 2 compared to Example 1, suggesting less variability in the mean CSI values over time in Example 2.

In terms of the mean std of CSI across the time axis, Example 2 had a smaller value compared to Example 1, indicating a lower degree of signal oscillation over time in Example 2. This could imply a more stable signal in Example 2.

For the given data in the question, the mean value of CSI is 0.2594, which falls within the range of the mean values in the previous examples. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.0309, which is slightly lower than Example 1 and similar to Example 2. The mean std of CSI across the time axis is 0.0607, which is higher than both previous examples.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis, considering the similarities in mean value and standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time with Example 1, along with the higher mean std of CSI across the time axis, it is likely that there is a person present. Therefore, the answer is: have_person.

Based on the analysis:
- The mean value of CSI being lower suggests a potential decrease in signal amplitude, which could indicate lesser human presence.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time being moderate could imply some fluctuations in the signal amplitude.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point being higher indicates a higher degree of signal oscillation over time.

ANSWER:
Based on the given data analysis, the combination of lower mean CSI value, moderate standard deviation, and higher mean std of CSI across the time axis suggests that there is a possibility of no person being present in the indoor space. Therefore, the final answer is: no_person.
