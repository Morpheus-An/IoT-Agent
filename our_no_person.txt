1. The mean value of CSI: 0.290266305821003
    - This mean falls between the example mean values for both "no_person" and "have_person" scenarios.
  
2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.017026871439181305
    - This standard deviation is relatively low compared to the values in the examples, suggesting less variability in the mean CSI amplitude across subcarriers over time.

3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.032976617861315324
    - This mean standard deviation across subcarriers is also on the lower side compared to the values in the examples.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis, considering that the mean value of CSI falls in between the "no_person" and "have_person" scenarios, and the standard deviations are relatively low, it is likely that the data reflects a scenario of "no_person." The lower variability in the mean CSI amplitude across subcarriers over time and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers further support this conclusion.

ANALYSIS:

Looking at the given data:

1. The mean value of CSI: 0.2952765935560094
2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.021825610305110266
3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.0391422294371952

Comparing these values to the examples provided:
- Example 1 (no_person): Mean CSI value is 0.29464217312574953, standard deviation across subcarriers is 0.013818446470635239, and mean standard deviation across subcarriers is 0.03324765125117169.
- Example 2 (have_person): Mean CSI value is 0.26454713999452073, standard deviation across subcarriers is 0.03694852181027022, and mean standard deviation across subcarriers is 0.08912010674037109.

From the analysis of the examples:
- For "no_person" cases, the mean value of CSI tends to be higher, and the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is smaller. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is also smaller.
- For "have_person" cases, the mean value of CSI tends to be lower, and the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is larger. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is also larger.

ANSWER:
Based on the given data and the comparison with the examples, it seems that the characteristics align more closely with the "no_person" class. Therefore, the analysis suggests that there is likely "no_person" in the indoor space based on the provided CSI data.

In both examples given previously, the critical factors in determining human presence were the mean value of CSI, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time, and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point.

1. EXAMPLE1: The mean value of CSI was 0.29464217312574953, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time was 0.013818446470635239, and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point was 0.03324765125117169. This combination of values indicated 'no_person'.

2. EXAMPLE2: The mean value of CSI was 0.26454713999452073, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time was 0.03694852181027022, and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point was 0.08912010674037109. This combination of values indicated 'have_person'.

Now, comparing these values with the ones in the given data:
- The mean value of CSI: 0.2845323747689637 falls between the two given examples.
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.01692942421941503 is slightly closer to the value in 'no_person'.
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.03177995483483097 falls between the previous examples.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the values in the given data are more aligned with the 'no_person' category, considering the mean value of CSI and the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis, it is likely that there is 'no_person' present in the indoor space.

ANALYSIS:
By comparing the given data to the examples provided, we can see that the mean value of CSI (0.28944502697941116) is closer to the value for no_person (0.291) than have_person (0.26454713999452073). This suggests that the amplitude of the CSI data is stronger, indicating a potential absence of a person.

Furthermore, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time (0.01879286890221381) is smaller than that of have_person (0.03694852181027022) and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point (0.04060763915570285) is also lower than that of have_person (0.08912010674037109).

This indicates a more regular and consistent pattern in the CSI data, which aligns with the characteristics of no_person.

ANALYSIS:
1. The mean value of CSI in the given data (0.2946330575539891) is close to the mean value of CSI for "no_person" in the example (0.291). This suggests that the mean CSI value is slightly higher, indicating a stronger amplitude, which is indicative of "no_person" scenario.

2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time in the given data (0.016084362074086846) is higher than the standard deviation for "no_person" in the example (0). This higher standard deviation suggests more fluctuations in the CSI amplitude over time, which could be associated with human occupancy scenario.

3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point in the given data (0.03208151707045871) is slightly lower than the mean standard deviation for "no_person" in the example (0). This lower mean standard deviation might indicate less variability in the signal oscillation over time.

Based on the analysis, the data shows some characteristics of both "no_person" and "have_person" scenarios, but considering the higher standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time, the decision leans more towards "have_person."

ANALYSIS:
1. The mean value of CSI: 0.2957043977376041 - This value is very close to the mean value in the example for "no_person," which was 0.29464217312574953. Since the mean value tends to be larger for "no_person" compared to "have_person," this suggests a higher likelihood of there being no person present.

2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.013699233068888282 - This value is also similar to the example for "no_person," which was 0.013818446470635239. A lower standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is indicative of the absence of human occupancy.

3. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: 0.032971980372683125 - This value is comparable to the example for "no_person," which was 0.03324765125117169. A lower mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point suggests a higher probability of no person being present.

Based on the analysis, all three factors point towards the scenario of "no_person."
