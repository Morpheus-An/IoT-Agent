In human occupancy detection using CSI measurements, the principle lies in the modulation of Wi-Fi signals caused by human presence and movement within the environment. When no individuals are present, the signal transmitted from the transmitter to the receiver follows a relatively stable path. However, when humans are present, their presence introduces changes in the propagation of the signal due to reflections, absorption, and scattering caused by the human body.

This results in alterations to the received signal at the receiver, leading to fluctuations in the Channel State Information (CSI) parameters, such as amplitude and phase. Specifically, the mean value of CSI tends to decrease when individuals are present compared to when the space is unoccupied, reflecting the attenuation or disruption of the signal caused by the human body.

Moreover, the dynamic movements of individuals can introduce significant variations and disturbances to the signal, resulting in increased noise and interference in the CSI data. Consequently, both the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point are higher in scenarios with human occupancy compared to those without, reflecting the increased variability and unpredictability of the signal due to human movement and activity.
