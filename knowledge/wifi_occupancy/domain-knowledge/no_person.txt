class: no_person
The CSI data: regular and with stronger amplitude
The mean value of CSI: larger than have_person
The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: smaller than have_person
The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point: smaller than have_person
If there is no person, thethe mean value is larger, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is smaller and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is smaller.
The precision of the decimal point for the mean and std should be concerned with 0.001.
