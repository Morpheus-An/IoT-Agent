The dataset contains 6-dimension rssi collected by 6 APs and the corresponding 2D positions.

It is important to note that the database containing several samples for each position as reference.
It provides the guidance to estimate the location of a new rssi sample. So when conducting WKNN, it is necessary to calculate the similarity between the input sample and the samples in database.
Then you need to rank the similarity and select the top K positions with the highest similarity.
Finally, you can use the weighted average to gain the final answer.

As all the information provided (including database, input rssi and WKNN algorithm), you can implement the algorithm by code to calculate it more correctly.
