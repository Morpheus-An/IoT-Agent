Based on the analysis of the given Wi-Fi CSI data, it is likely that there is no person present in the indoor space. The mean value of CSI is larger than the average mean value for the 'no_person' class, and the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is smaller than the average value for the 'no_person' class. However, the decision is not solely based on one metric, so further analysis and consideration of all factors is recommended.
ANALYSIS:
In analyzing the provided CSI data, we first observe the overall pattern of the signal amplitudes across the 21 subcarriers and 20 time samples. We notice fluctuations in the amplitude values, indicating possible human movement within the space. The mean value of CSI is calculated to be 0.278, which falls within the range of values associated with having a person present.

Next, we look at the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time, which is 0.019. This value is relatively low, suggesting that the variations in the mean CSI amplitude across different subcarriers are not significant, potentially indicating a more stable environment with consistent signal strength.

Finally, we consider the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point, which is 0.031. This value, while higher than the previous standard deviation, is still relatively low, indicating that the oscillations of the signal across subcarriers are not drastic.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the provided CSI data and comparing it with the characteristics associated with human occupancy patterns, the data suggests that there is a person present in the indoor space.

Furthermore, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.024, which is also in line with the values indicative of the "no_person" class, being smaller compared to values associated with the presence of a person.

Similarly, the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.039, which also matches the criteria for the "no_person" class, where smaller fluctuations are expected in the absence of human occupancy.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the CSI data characteristics, including the mean value, standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time, and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point, we can confidently conclude that there is no person present in the indoor space. Therefore, the occupancy status is determined to be "no_person."
**ANALYSIS:**

1. **Signal Data Analysis:**
   - The given CSI data consists of 20 time-series signal samples across 21 subcarriers.
   - The amplitudes of the signal samples vary from around 0.08 to 0.6, showing fluctuations.

2. **Mean Value Analysis:**
   - The mean value of CSI is calculated as 0.2919, indicating an average amplitude level across all subcarriers over time.

3. **Standard Deviation Analysis:**
   - The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is found to be 0.0271, which shows the variability of the mean amplitude across different subcarriers.
   - The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is calculated as 0.0454, reflecting the overall signal oscillation in time.

4. **Comparison with Previous Examples:**
   - Based on the information provided in the expert knowledge section, a higher mean value of CSI, lower standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time, and lower mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point typically indicate 'no_person'.
   - Conversely, a lower mean value of CSI, higher standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time, and higher mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point suggest 'have_person'.

**ANSWER:**
Based on the analysis of the given data, it can be inferred that the CSI data exhibits fluctuations, the mean value is around 0.29, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is relatively low at 0.0271, and the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.0454.

Therefore, considering the comparison with the characteristics associated with 'no_person' and 'have_person' classes, the analysis indicates that the data reflects a scenario of **no_person**.
ANALYSIS:
- The CSI data provided shows variations in amplitude across different subcarriers over time.

ANALYSIS:
Based on the given data, we can see that the CSI data exhibits fluctuations and weaker amplitudes across the time-series and subcarriers. The mean value of CSI is 0.297, which is larger than the average mean value of 0.291 for scenarios with no person. Additionally, the standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.018, smaller than the average value for scenarios with no person. The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.039, which is larger than the average value for scenarios with no person.

This implies that the data provided shows characteristics typically associated with scenarios where a person is present, such as fluctuations and weaker amplitudes. The mean value is closer to the average value for scenarios with a person, and the standard deviations indicate variability and unpredictability typically seen in the presence of human movement.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the CSI data provided, it is likely that there is a person present in the indoor space.
ANALYSIS:
Looking at the given CSI data, we can observe that the amplitudes of the signals are varying across the 20 samples and 21 subcarriers. There seems to be fluctuations in the data, indicating potential human movements within the indoor space. The mean value of CSI is 0.296, which is closer to the characteristic mean value associated with no_person class.
The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.018, which is relatively lower, suggesting a more stable signal pattern. Similarly, the mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.035, also pointing towards less variability.
Comparing these values with the characteristics of both no_person and have_person classes, the data in this scenario align more closely with the characteristics of the no_person class. The mean value is higher, and the standard deviations are lower, indicative of a scenario without human presence.

ANSWER:
Based on the analysis of the given data, it is likely that there is no person present in the indoor space.
ANALYSIS:
From the given CSI data, we can observe that the signal amplitudes are relatively stable across subcarriers but show some fluctuations over time. The mean value of CSI is 0.2977, which falls in between the average values for "no_person" (0.291) and "have_person" (0.267). The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is 0.0131, which is smaller than the average for "have_person" (0.023) but larger than the average for "no_person" (0).

The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is 0.0272, which is also within the range of the averages for both classes.

Based on the analysis of the data, the fluctuations in the signal are not very pronounced, and the mean value of CSI is also moderate. Therefore, the data suggests that there is most likely no person present in the indoor space.

ANSWER:
no_person
ANALYSIS:

Based on the given CSI data, we observe the following:
1. The mean value of CSI: 0.2957
2. The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time: 0.0137

Comparing these values with the characteristics mentioned for both classes:
- The mean value of CSI falls within the range for the class "no_person."
- The standard deviation across subcarriers for the mean CSI amplitude over time is smaller, indicating characteristics of "no_person."
- The mean standard deviation across subcarriers for each time point is smaller, also aligning with the characteristics of "no_person."

Overall, the data reflects signals with smaller fluctuations and stronger amplitudes, which are indicative of the absence of a person.
